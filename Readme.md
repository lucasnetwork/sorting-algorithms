# Sorting Algorithms

## Selection sorting
Find the smallest value of array and replaces with the current position.

- Complexity: O($n^2$)
- Unstable sorting algorithm

## Bubble sorting
get the current position and next position, check if the current position is greater than the next position,if so, the values of positions will be exchanged.

- Complexity: O($n^2$)
- Stable sorting algorithm
